Greetings! Welcome to the Project Starbase Installation Instructions. This will be divided into a number of steps:

Step 1:
	Install the Appserv system from https://www.appserv.org/en/. 
	Apache HTTP Server Information:
		Server Name: localhost
		Apache HTTP Port: 80
		Root password: pancakes
	
Step 2: Using MySQLFront (http://www.mysqlfront.de/), import the starbasedata.sql file to create the database.
	
	
Step 3: Copy the provided starbase folder to your Appserv/www/ folder.
	From an internet browser, type in localhost/starbase/login.php to run the application. That's it!
	
We hope you have a great time with the Project Starbase system!
